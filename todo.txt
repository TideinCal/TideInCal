A. Android import instruction text.
    The default android import will import tide events to your default calendar, filling it with thousands of events that you might need to manually delete. We recommend the following steps:
    1. Create a new calendar for your tides, in the calendar app of your choice. Google link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/createcalendar
    2. If using Google, use the desktop site on your mobile browser to import the ICS file. Google link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/export
        If you have your Google account tied to Outlook, you can open the ICS file with the Outlook app and will be able to choose the calendar to import to.
