# TideInCal
This is a web application that allows a user to put 1 year
worth of High and Low Tide Time into their Calendar.

The user can allow us to automatically find their location
on the map, or they type in their location on the to
corner of the map.

Once they have found their location the user can select a
designated marker (tide station) and download 1 year of high
and low tide data of their desired location into their
iCalendar, Google Calendar, or Outlook.
